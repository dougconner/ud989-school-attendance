===========================
This exercise was to refactor or redo from scratch the original spaghetti code into a model-view-controller design. The original code is on the master branch and the refactored code is in the refactor1 branch. I have not commented out rather than delete the existing code because at some point I would like to re-implement the local storage feature (not part of the assignment) to learn how to use it. It would also be useful to add an admin feature for editing students, number of days, etc.
